# Gradebook

This is the example application for the Rails Developer position at Viget.
Building this application is the primary way we will judge your skills and
suitability for the position from a technical perspective. This is not an
exercise to weed out the non-programmers -- if you're at this stage of the
interview process, we know you can program, now show us what you've got.

We anticipate this exercise taking candidates 4 - 6 hours to complete and
submit. We recognize that this is a significant investment of your time and we
appreciate that investment. We will invest the same amount of care in reviewing
and providing feedback on your submission.

To get started, just clone this repository and continue work on the master
branch.

## Exercise

We'd like you to build an application that allows for the recording and
reporting of courses offered by teachers and taken by students. It should
satisfy these stories:

* A Teacher can manage his course roster
* A Teacher can view the enrolled students and their grades for a given course
* A Student can see the courses he is registered for (with grades)
* A Student can see his GPA for a given semester
* An Administrator can view enrollment counts across all courses for a semester
  (performance is a concern)
* An Administrator can view an average grade for a given course (performance is
  a concern)

## Evaluation

We expect you to demonstrate proficiency with:

* Database design and normalization
* Object-Oriented design and programming
* Ruby and Rails consistent with your experience
* SQL beyond simple `SELECT` / `INSERT` / `UPDATE` queries
* Test-Driven Development practices. This will be evaluated from your git
  history

When we evaluate your submission, we will be reviewing it in the context of
your professional experience. We don't expect a novice to be writing more
advanced code, and we wouldn't expect an advanced programmer to be writing
novice code -- keep that in mind as you do the exercise.

## Submission

Once you've completed the exercise:

1. Make sure you can run the app from scratch (e.g. `bundle && rake db:migrate
   && rails server`)
1. Run all tests to ensure that they are still passing
1. Document any special considerations for running / using the application

Once you're ready to send us your working application:

1. Since you cloned this repository, you already have a git repo initialized
1. Create a git bundle of your local repo from the master branch:

   ```shell
   $ git bundle create yourname-gradebook.bundle master
   ```

   This will create a file that contains all of your git history in the master
   branch. To ensure it works, feel free to test it in another folder by
   running:

   ```shell
   $ git clone -b master ./yourname-gradebook.bundle ../testing-bundle-file
   ```

1. Email your submission to developers@viget.com

If you have any questions during this exercise, please feel free to email
developers@viget.com with any questions.
